## Note:

The bot currently uses the prefix "$" to instantiate commands.
I may update the bot to use the newer "slash" commands that
provide the user with a graphical interface for the bot's commands,
but when I asked some people if they'd prefer that: a majority said
they prefer the prefix, so consequently for the time being I'll stick
to the old prefix commands, but that may change in the future if
discord decides to completely remove them or if
people really want them and I can be bothered to re-write each file.
